Add-ons using the techniques described in this document are considered a
legacy technology in Firefox. Don't use these techniques to develop new add-
ons. Use [WebExtensions](/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) instead. If you
maintain an add-on which uses the techniques described here, consider
migrating it to use WebExtensions.

 **Starting from[Firefox 53](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar),
no new legacy add-ons will be accepted on addons.mozilla.org (AMO) for desktop
Firefox and Firefox for Android.**

 **Starting from[Firefox 57](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar),
only extensions developed using WebExtensions APIs will be supported on
Desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android. **

Even before Firefox 57, changes coming up in the Firefox platform will break
many legacy extensions. These changes include multiprocess Firefox (e10s),
sandboxing, and multiple content processes. Legacy extensions that are
affected by these changes should migrate to use WebExtensions APIs if they
can. See the ["Compatibility Milestones"
document](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57
-compatibility-milestones/) for more information.

A wiki page containing [resources, migration paths, office hours, and
more](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/developer/communication), is available
to help developers transition to the new technologies.
