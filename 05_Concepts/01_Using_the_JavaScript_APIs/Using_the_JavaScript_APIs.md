JavaScript APIs forÂ WebExtensions can be used inside the extension's [background scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#Background_scripts) and in any other documents bundled with the extension, including [browser action](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_action) or [page action](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Page_actions) popups, [sidebars](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Sidebars), [options pages](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Options_pages), or [new tab pages](/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_url_overrides). A few of these APIs can also be accessed by an extension's [content scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#Content_scripts) (see the [list in the content script guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#WebExtension_APIs)).

To use the more powerful APIs you need to [request permission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions) in your extension's manifest.json.

You can access the APIs using the `browser` namespace:

    
    
    function logTabs(tabs) {
      console.log(tabs);
    }
    
    browser.tabs.query({currentWindow: true}, logTabs);

Many of the APIs are asynchronous, returning a `[Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)`:

    
    
    function logCookie(c) {
      console.log(c);
    }
    
    function logError(e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
    
    var setCookie = browser.cookies.set(
      {url: "https://developer.mozilla.org/"}
    );
    setCookie.then(logCookie, logError);

Note that this is different from Google Chrome's extension system, which uses the `chrome` namespace instead of `browser`, and which uses callbacks instead of promises for asynchronous functions. As a porting aid, the Firefox implementation of WebExtensions APIs supports `chrome` and callbacks as well as `browser` and promises. Mozilla has also written a polyfill which enables code that uses `browser` and promises to work unchanged in Chrome: <https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill>.

Firefox also implements these APIs under the `chrome` namespace using callbacks. This allows code written for Chrome to run largely unchanged in Firefox for the APIs documented here.

Microsoft Edge uses the `browser` namespace, but doesn't yet support promise-based asynchronous APIs. In Edge, for the time being, asynchronous APIs must use callbacks.

Not all browsers support all the APIs: for the details, see [Browser support for JavaScript APIs](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs).

## alarms

Schedule code to run at a specific time in the future. This is like`[setTimeout()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout)` and`[setInterval()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval)`, except that those functions don't work with background pages that are loaded on demand.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n)

## identity

Use the identity API to get an [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization code or access token, which an extension can then use to access user data from a service which supports OAuth2 access (such as a Google or a Facebook account).

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity)

## idle

Find out when the user's system is idle, locked, or active.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/idle)

## management

Get information about installed add-ons.

## menus

Add items to the browser's menu system.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus)

## notifications

Display notifications to the user, using the underlying operating system's notification mechanism. Because this API uses the operating system's notification mechanism, the details of how notifications appear and behave may differ according to the operating system and the user's settings.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/notifications)

## omnibox

Enables extensions to implement customised behavior when the user types into the browser's address bar.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/omnibox)

## pageAction

A [page action](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Page_actions) is a lickable icon inside the browser's address bar.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pageAction)

## permissions

Extensions need permissions to access many of the more powerful WebExtension APIs. They can ask for permissions at install time by including the permissions they need in the `[permissions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions)` manifest.json key. The main advantages of asking for permissions at install time are:

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/permissions)

## pkcs11

The `pkcs11` API enables an extension to enumerate [PKCS#11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11) security modules, and to make them accessible to the browser as sources of keys and certificates.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pkcs11)

## privacy

Access and modify various privacy-related browser settings.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/privacy)

## proxy

Use the proxy API to register an extended [Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file](/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/proxy#PAC_file_specification), which implements a policy for proxying web requests. This implementation deviates from standard PAC design in several ways because the de-facto specification for PAC files hasn't changed since its initial implementation circa 1995. There is no standards body maintaining the specification.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/proxy)

## runtime

This module provides information about your extension and the environment it's running in.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime)

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webNavigation)

## webRequest

Add event listeners for the various stages of making an HTTP request. The event listener receives detailed information about the request, and can modify or cancel the request.

[API reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest)
