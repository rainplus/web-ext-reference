by dots. For the details of the version format, see the [Version
format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Toolkit_version_format) page.

Note that [the syntax defined for Chrome's
`version`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/version) is more
restrictive than that used by Firefox:

\n

\n

  * values for `version` that are valid for Chrome will always be valid for Firefox
\n

  * values for `version` that are valid for Firefox may not be valid for Chrome
\n
