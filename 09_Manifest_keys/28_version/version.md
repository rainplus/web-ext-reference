Version of the extension, formatted as numbers and ASCII characters separated
by dots. For the details of the version format, see the [Version
format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Toolkit_version_format) page.



Note that [the syntax defined for Chrome's
`version`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/version) is more
restrictive than that used by Firefox:





  * values for `version` that are valid for Chrome will always be valid for Firefox


  * values for `version` that are valid for Firefox may not be valid for Chrome




## Example



    
    
    "version": "0.1"
