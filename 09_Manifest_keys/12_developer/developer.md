    "developer": {
      "name": "Walt Whitman",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman"
    }  
  
The name of the extension's developer and their homepage URL, intended for
display in the browser's user interface.

The object, and both of its properties, are optional. The "name" and "url"
properties, if present, will override theÂ  [author](/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/author) and [homepage_url](/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/homepage_url) keys, respectively. This object
only allows for a single developer name and URL to be specified.

This is a [localizable property](/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#Internationalizing_manifest.json).

## Example

    
    
    "developer": {
      "name": "Walt Whitman",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman"
    }
