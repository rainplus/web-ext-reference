Functions to internationalize your extension. You can use these APIs to get
localized strings from locale files packaged with your extension, find out the
browser's current language, and find out the value of its [Accept-Language
header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#The_Accept-Language_header).

For more details on using i18n for your extension, see:

  * [Internationalization](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization): a guide to using the WebExtension i18n system.
  * [Locale-Specific Message reference](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/Locale-Specific_Message_reference): extensions supply locale-specific strings in files called `messages.json`. This page describes the format of `messages.json`.

## Types

[`i18n.LanguageCode`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/LanguageCode "The documentation about this has not
yet been written; please consider contributing!")

    A [language tag](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.10) such as `"en-US"` or "`fr`".

## Functions

[`i18n.getAcceptLanguages()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/getAcceptLanguages "Gets the accept-languages of
the browser. This is different from the locale used by the browser. To get the
locale, use i18n.getUILanguage.")

    Gets the [accept-languages](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#The_Accept-Language_header) of the browser. This is different from the locale used by the browser. To get the locale, use [`i18n.getUILanguage`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/getUILanguage "Gets the UI language of the browser. This is different from i18n.getAcceptLanguages which returns the preferred user languages.").
[`i18n.getMessage()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/getMessage "Gets the localized string for the
specified message.")

    Gets the localized string for the specified message.
[`i18n.getUILanguage()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/getUILanguage "Gets the UI language of the browser.
This is different from i18n.getAcceptLanguages which returns the preferred
user languages.")

    Gets the UI language of the browser. This is different from [`i18n.getAcceptLanguages`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/getAcceptLanguages "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!") which returns the preferred user languages.
[`i18n.detectLanguage()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/detectLanguage "Detects the language of the
provided text using the Compact Language Detector \(CLD\).")

    Detects the language of the provided text using the [Compact Language Detector](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2).
