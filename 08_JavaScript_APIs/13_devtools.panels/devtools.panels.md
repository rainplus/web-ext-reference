Although the APIs are based on the [Chrome devtools
APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools), there are still many
features that are not yet implemented in Firefox, and therefore are not
documented here. To see which features are currently missing please see
[Limitations of the devtools APIs](/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/Using_the_devtools_APIs#Limitations_of_the_devtools_APIs).

The `devtools.panels` API lets a devtools extension define its user interface
inside the devtools window.

The devtools window hosts a number of separate tools - the JavaScript
Debugger, Network Monitor, and so on. A row of tabs across the top lets the
user switch between the different tools. The window hosting each tool's user
interface is called a "panel".

With the `devtools.panels` API you can create new panels in the devtools
window.

Like all the `devtools` APIs, this API is only available to code running in
the document defined in the [devtools_page](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/devtools_page) manifest.json key, or in other
devtools documents created by the extension (such as the panel's own
document). See [Extending the developer tools](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/Extending_the_developer_tools) for more.

when the user switches between devtools panels. See [bug
1412317](https://bugzil.la/1412317).

2\. The expression must evaluate to a JavaScript object or a DOM node, or
nothing is shown in the sidebar.

3\. The expression must evaluate to an object that can be serialized to JSON,
or nothing is shown in the sidebar. In particular, JavaScript cyclic objects
and DOM nodes are not supported. See [bug 1403130](https://bugzil.la/1403130).

4\. If the `jsonObject` parameter is a string, it is not displayed.

5\. If the `jsonObject` is a string, then `rootTitle` must also be given, or
`jsonObject` will not be displayed. See [bug
1412310](https://bugzil.la/1412310).
