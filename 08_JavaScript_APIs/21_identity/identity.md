Use the identity API to get an [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) authorization
code or access token, which an extension can then use to access user data from
a service which supports OAuth2 access (such as a Google or a Facebook
account).

Details of how the OAuth2 flow works differ from one service provider to
another, so to use this API with a particular service provider, you'll need to
consult their documentation. For example:

  * <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent>
  * <https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/>

The identity API provides the [`identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`](/en-
US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/launchWebAuthFlow "Performs
the first part of an OAuth2 flow, including user authentication and client
authorization.") function. This authenticates the user with the service, if
necessary, and asks the user to authorize the extension to access data, if
necessary. The function completes with an access token or authorization code,
depending on the provider.

The extension then completes the OAuth2 flow to get a validated access token,
and can then use this in HTTP requests to access the user's data according to
the authorization the user gave.

To use this API, you must have the "identity" [API permission](/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#API_permissions).

## Setup

There's some setup you must do before publishing your extension.

### Getting the redirect URL

The [redirect URL](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/)
represents the end point of [`identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`](/en-
US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/launchWebAuthFlow "Performs
the first part of an OAuth2 flow, including user authentication and client
authorization."), in which the access token or authorization code is delivered
to the extension.

You can get a redirect URL by calling [`identity.getRedirectURL()`](/en-
US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/getRedirectURL "Generates a
URL that you can use as a redirect URL."). This function derives a redirect
URL from the add-on's ID, so if you want to use it, you should probably set
your add-on's ID explicitly using the `[applications](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/applications)` key (otherwise, each time you
[temporarily install the add-on](/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox), you'll get a different
redirect URL).

You don't have to use the redirect URL returned by
`identity.getRedirectURL()`: you can supply your own, and it can be anything
that the service will redirect to. However, it should use a domain that you
control.

You'll use the redirect URL in two places:

  * supply it when registering your extension as an OAuth2 client
  * pass it into `identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`, as a URL parameter added to that function's `url` argument.

### Registering your extension

Before you can use OAuth2 with a service provider, you must register the
extension with the provider as an OAuth2 client.

This will tend to be specific to the service provider, but in general it means
creating an entry for your extension on the provider's website. In this
process you willÂ supply your redirect URL, and receive a client ID (and
sometimes also a secret). You'll need to pass both of these into
[`identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/launchWebAuthFlow "Performs the first part of
an OAuth2 flow, including user authentication and client authorization.").

## Functions

[`identity.getRedirectURL()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/getRedirectURL "Generates a URL that you can
use as a redirect URL.")

    Gets the redirect URL.
[`identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/launchWebAuthFlow "Performs the first part of
an OAuth2 flow, including user authentication and client authorization.")

    Launches WAF.
