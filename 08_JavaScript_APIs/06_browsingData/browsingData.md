Enables extensions to clear the data that is accumulated while the user is
browsing.

In the `browsingData` API, browsing data is divided into types:

  * browser cache
  * cookies
  * downloads
  * history
  * local storage
  * plugin data
  * saved form data
  * saved passwords

You can use the [`browsingData.remove()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/browsingData/remove "Removes the specified browsing
data.") function to remove any combination of these types. There are also
dedicated functions to remove each particular type of data, such as
[`removePasswords()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/browsingData/removePasswords "The documentation about
this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"),
[`removeHistory()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/browsingData/removeHistory "The documentation about this
has not yet been written; please consider contributing!") and so on.

All the `browsingData.remove[X]()` functions take a
[`browsingData.RemovalOptions`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/browsingData/RemovalOptions "The
browsingData.RemovalOptions type contains options to control certain aspects
of browsing data removal.") object, which you can use to control two further
aspects of data removal:

  * how far back in time to remove data
  * whether to remove data only from normal web pages, or also from hosted web apps and add-ons. Note that this option is not yet supported in Firefox.

Finally, this API gives you aÂ [`browsingData.settings()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla
/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browsingData/settings "Browsers have a built-in
"Clear History" feature, which enables the user to clear various types of
browsing data. This has a UI that enables the user to select what type of data
to remove \(e.g. history, downloads, ...\) and how far back in time to remove
data.") function that gives you the current value of the settings for the
browser's built-in "Clear History" feature.

To use this API you must have the "browsingData" [API
permission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#API_permissions).

## Types

[`browsingData.DataTypeSet`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-

type describes a set of data types.")

    Object used to specify the type of data to remove: for example, history, downloads, passwords, and so on.
[`browsingData.RemovalOptions`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-
ons/WebExtensions/API/browsingData/RemovalOptions "The
browsingData.RemovalOptions type contains options to control certain aspects
of browsing data removal.")

    Object used to specify how far back in time to remove data, and whether to remove data added through normal web browsing, by hosted apps, or by add-ons.
