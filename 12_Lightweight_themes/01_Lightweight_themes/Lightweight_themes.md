Lightweight themes are sometimes referred to as "Background themes" or, (on
[addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)) as just
"Themes".

## How to Create Your Own Lightweight theme

\n

\n

Lightweight themes are made up of a "header" graphic image file, which skins
the default Firefox UI background.

\n

### Creating a Theme Header Image

\n

The header image is displayed as the background of the top of the browser
window, nestling in behind the toolbars, address bar, search bar and the tab
strip. It will be **anchored to the top-right corner** of the browser window.

\n

\n

#### Image Requirements

\n

\n

  * Dimensions should be **3000px wide \xd7 200px high**
\n

  * PNG or JPG file format
\n

  * Image must be no larger than 300 KB in file size
\n

\n

#### Tips

\n

\n

  * Subtle, soft contrast images and gradients work best; highly detailed images will compete with the browser UI.
\n

  * Firefox may reveal more of the lower portion of the image if another toolbar or other UI element is added to the top of the window.
\n

  * The upper right-hand side of the image should have the most important information\u2014as a user increases the width of the browser window, the browser reveals more of the left-hand side of the image.
\n

  * Ultrawide monitors can run to 3440px wide, to look good on these monitors, either increase the size of the image or ensure the left of the image fades to a solid colour.
\n

\n
