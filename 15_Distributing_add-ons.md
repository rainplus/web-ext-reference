The standard add-on distribution and installation process is through Firefox
using a signed XPI file obtained from
[addons.mozilla.org](http://addons.mozilla.org) (AMO) (for listed add-ons) or
a download set up by a developer (for unlisted add-ons).

These methods may not suit everyone, for example, where an add-on is bundled
with a native application or an enterprise wishes to install an add-on for all
their instances of Firefox. This section describes the alternatives.

  * [Sideloading add-ons](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_distribution_options/Sideloading_add-ons) — enables a user to install an add-on using an XPI file saved on their computer.

  * [Add-ons for use with a desktop app](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_distribution_options/Add-ons_for_desktop_apps) — this section describes the best practices for delivering an add-on for use with a desktop application.

  * [Add-ons in an enterprise environment](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_distribution_options/Add-ons_in_the_enterprise) — this page discusses the use of signed compared to unsigned add-ons, installation options, the Firefox settings affecting installation, and including add-ons with a custom Firefox install package.
