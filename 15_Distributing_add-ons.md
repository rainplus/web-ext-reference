The standard add-on distribution and installation process is through Firefox
using a signed XPI file obtained from
[addons.mozilla.org](http://addons.mozilla.org) (AMO) (for listed add-ons) or
a download set up by a developer (for unlisted add-ons).

\n

These methods may not suit everyone, for example, where an add-on is bundled
with a native application or an enterprise wishes to install an add-on for all
their instances of Firefox. This section describes the alternatives.
